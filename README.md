# GIFT
General Image Fiber Tool (GIFT) is an ImageJ macro tool which allows the users to measure the average diameter of electrospun fibers in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. The theory and method behind GIFT is thoroughly explained and validated in our previously published work (Götz et al, 2021. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.measurement.2021.109265 ) [1].  Measuring fiber diameters as an experimental endpoint or as a means of quality control is an important step in the fabrication of nonwoven materials. GIFT allows for the quick and reliable batch analysis of large sets of images and allows users control over the image analysis parameters. Results are presented in summarized or raw data formats. GIFT may also be applied to non-electrospinning images, and examples are given in the supplemental info section of Götz et al 2021 [1].
